# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect Case in innerHTML This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML involving the use of JavaScript's innerHTML property.  The bug arises from a simple typo, using lowercase 'innerHtml' instead of the correct 'innerHTML'.  This results in the JavaScript code failing to update the HTML content correctly. The solution corrects the casing and provides the expected behavior.  This is important because such typos can be difficult to spot during code review or testing. The detailed explanation is available within the bug.html and bugSolution.html files.
